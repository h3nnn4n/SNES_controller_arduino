# SNES controller on a pc using an arduino

This is my own implementation of an arduino based interface between a SNES controller and a PC running GNU/Linux.
The project consists of two parts: One is the arduino which is connected to the controller and to the PC via an USB cable, the other part is a software running on the userspace which parses the datta from the arduino and simulates keypresses.
